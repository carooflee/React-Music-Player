## React Music Player
 
A simple React-based music player with a set-playlist.

# Motivation

As a person who loves music, I would like to be able to listen to my music online while I go about my various activities on the web, and would be particularly happy if the player was trans pride color-coded.

# Installation
  `npm install`
  
Then launch with `npm start` and it will appear in your browser.
    
    
# Usage

When the music playlist has been loaded on the page, click the white square to the left of the song title and artist, and the song will began playing. You can then choose to fast foward with the button on the bottom bar on the left, pause with the button in the middle, and skip forward with the button on the right.
